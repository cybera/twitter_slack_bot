# Contributing

The Cybera twitter_slack_bot project is an open source project initially developed as part of an internal professional learning activity. We welcome contributions of all kinds including new features, fixes, bug reports, and more. 

This contributing document has been adapted from [Software / Data Carpentry](https://github.com/datacarpentry/geospatial-workshop/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md).
In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of us.

1.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create one][github-join], you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues]. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR). 

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
To manage changes, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow]. 
To use the web interface for contributing to a lesson:

1.  Fork the master repository to your GitHub profile.
2.  Within your version of the forked repository, move to the `main` branch and create a new branch for each significant change being made.
3.  Navigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the new branches and make revisions as required.
4.  Commit all changed files within the appropriate branches.
5.  Create individual pull requests from each of your changed branches to the `main` branch within the master repository.
6.  If you receive feedback, make changes using your issue-specific branches of the forked repository and the pull requests will update automatically.
7.  Repeat as needed until all feedback has been addressed.

When starting work, please make sure your clone of the master `main` branch is up-to-date before creating your own revision-specific branch(es) from there.
Additionally, please only work from your newly-created branch(es) and *not* your clone of the master `main` branch.
